    """Creates adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).

    This function implements the FGSM attack, a single-step gradient-based method
    for generating adversarial examples, as originally proposed by Goodfellow et al.
    The attack works by taking a single step in the direction of the gradient of
    the loss function with respect to the input data.

    The perturbation is calculated to maximize the loss (for untargeted attacks)
    or minimize it (for targeted attacks) within an $L_p$ ball of radius epsilon.

    Args:
        model_fn: A callable model function (e.g., a PyTorch Module) that takes
            a tensor input and returns the model's logits.
        x: The input tensor to be perturbed.
        eps: The magnitude of the perturbation (epsilon), controlling the
            attack strength within the specified norm.
        norm: The norm order to use for the perturbation ($L_\infty$, $L_1$, or $L_2$).
            Accepts `np.inf`, `1`, or `2`.
        loss_fn: The loss function used to compute the gradient (e.g.,
            `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`).
        clip_min: An optional tensor for the minimum value to which the
            adversarial example will be clipped.
        clip_max: An optional tensor for the maximum value to which the
            adversarial example will be clipped.
        y: The ground-truth or target labels. If `None`, the model's own
            predictions on the clean input `x` are used.
        targeted: If `True`, the attack is targeted and aims to misclassify the
            input as the class specified in `y`. If `False` (default), the
            attack is untargeted and aims to maximize the loss for the
            correct class.
        sanity_checks: If `True`, performs assertions to check that the input `x`
            is within the `[clip_min, clip_max]` range.

    Returns:
        An adversarial tensor of the same shape as `x` that has been perturbed
        to fool the model.
