    """Generates adversarial examples for a batch of inputs using a specified method.

    This function is a wrapper that performs adversarial attacks (either FGSM or PGD)
    on a batch of inputs. It takes a Keras model and numpy arrays, converts them
    to PyTorch tensors to leverage attack libraries, generates the adversarial
    examples, and returns the model's predictions on them as a numpy array.

    The generated adversarial examples are constrained to lie within the provided
    per-sample lower and upper bounds.

    Args:
        model: The Keras model to attack. It will be temporarily converted for use
            with PyTorch.
        input_sample_batch: A batch of nominal input samples.
        lower_bound_batch: A batch of lower bound arrays, defining the clipping
            region for each sample.
        upper_bound_batch: A batch of upper bound arrays, defining the clipping
            region for each sample.
        gt_label: The ground-truth label, used as the target for the attack
            (i.e., the attack tries to move the prediction away from this label).
        eps: The perturbation budget (epsilon) for the $L_\infty$ norm.
        method: The attack algorithm to use. Supported options are "fgsm" and "pgd".
        device: The computation device (e.g., "mps", "cuda", "cpu").

    Returns:
        A numpy array containing the model's predicted class labels for the
        generated adversarial examples.
