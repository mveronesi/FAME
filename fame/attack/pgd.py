    """Creates adversarial examples using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).

    This function implements the PGD attack, a strong, iterative method for
    generating adversarial examples, as originally proposed by Madry et al.
    PGD is essentially a multi-step version of FGSM.

    The attack works by:
    1. Optionally starting from a random point within the allowed perturbation space.
    2. Iteratively taking small steps (using FGSM as the inner step) in the
       direction that maximizes the loss.
    3. After each step, projecting the total perturbation back onto the $L_p$
       ball of radius `eps` to ensure the constraint is not violated.
    4. Clipping the resulting example to a valid data range (e.g., [0, 1]).

    Args:
        model_fn: A callable model function (e.g., a PyTorch Module) that takes
            a tensor input and returns the model's logits.
        x: The input tensor to be perturbed.
        eps: The total perturbation budget (radius of the $L_p$ ball).
        eps_iter: The step size for each attack iteration.
        nb_iter: The number of attack iterations to perform.
        norm: The norm order to use for the perturbation ($L_\infty$ or $L_2$).
            Accepts `np.inf` or `2`.
        loss_fn: The loss function used to compute the gradient.
        clip_min: An optional tensor for the minimum value to which the
            adversarial example will be clipped at each iteration.
        clip_max: An optional tensor for the maximum value to which the
            adversarial example will be clipped at each iteration.
        y: The ground-truth or target labels. If `None`, the model's own
            predictions on the clean input `x` are used.
        targeted: If `True`, performs a targeted attack. If `False` (default),
            the attack is untargeted.
        rand_init: If `True`, starts the attack from a random point within the
            epsilon ball, which can improve attack success.
        rand_minmax: The range (`-rand_minmax` to `+rand_minmax`) for the
            random initialization. Defaults to `eps`.
        sanity_checks: If `True`, performs assertions on inputs.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - `adv_x` (Tensor): The final adversarial example found after `nb_iter` steps.
        - `x_hist` (List[Tensor]): A list of adversarial examples from each
          iteration of the attack.
