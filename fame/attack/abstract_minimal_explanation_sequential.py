    """Identifies a minimal set of robust features required to prevent adversarial attacks.

    This function searches for a partition of input features into two sets: a set of
    "vulnerable" features and a minimal set of "robust" features. Fixing the
    robust set is sufficient to ensure the model's prediction remains correct
    against attacks on the vulnerable set. This can be interpreted as finding a
    concise explanation for the model's robustness (or lack thereof).

    The algorithm operates as follows:
    1.  It first checks if an adversarial attack is possible when all features
        are perturbed. If not, the search is skipped.
    2.  It identifies any features that can cause a misclassification on their own.
    3.  It then iteratively builds up the robust set by adding features one by
        one (in a greedy order of influence). After adding each feature, it
        re-evaluates the remaining features to see if they have now become
        vulnerable in this new context.

    Args:
        model: The Keras model to be analyzed.
        gt_label: The ground-truth class label to defend.
        input_sample: A single input point serving as the center of the
            perturbation.
        eps: The radius of the $L_\infty$ perturbation.
        xai_indices: A list of pre-defined XAI feature indices, excluded from
            the search.
        free_indices: A list of feature indices that are always considered
            perturbed.
        method: The adversarial attack algorithm to use (e.g., "fgsm").
        device: The computational device to run on (e.g., "mps", "cuda").
        channel: The number of channels in the input data.
        data_format: The data format, either "channels_first" or "channels_last".
        n_class: The number of output classes of the model.
        traversal_order: The strategy for iterating through features. Currently,
            only "greedy" is supported.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing two lists of feature indices:
        - **vulnerable_features** (list[int]): The set of features that can
          contribute to a successful adversarial attack.
        - **robust_subset** (list[int]): The minimal set of features that, when
          considered robust (i.e., perturbed alongside `free_indices`),
          are sufficient to guarantee the model's correctness against attacks on
          the `vulnerable_features`.
